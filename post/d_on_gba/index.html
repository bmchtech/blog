language</a> and we wanted it ported to GBA.</p><div id=outline-container-why-port-d class=outline-3><h3 id=why-port-d>why port D?</h3><div id=outline-text-why-port-d class=outline-text-3><p>initially, when we began developing for the GBA, we used
<a href=https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started>devkitarm</a> as a build
toolchain, and the
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/duster/blob/ee741183d9a19e3759a1cc11427d01751a13e2d3/src/DusterGBA/Makefile>makefiles</a>
I created for <a href=https://github.com/redthing1/dusk>dusk</a>, which in turn
were based on tonc makefiles. this worked fine and all, but I really
don't love C; it has simplicity going for it, but it's full of ugly
syntax, extremely unsafe code, and hidden pitfalls.</p><p>D, on the other hand, emphasizes compile time checking and sanity. on a
system like the GBA, your code is running on bare metal, and there's
really no runtime error checking of any kind. any undefined behavior you
do will just get steamrolled over. good luck tracking down what caused a
bizarre memory corruption bug. overall, using D would be a huge benefit
in preventing entire classes of errors before they happen, just through
virtue of strict and smart compile time checking available with D. C++
has modules now? i don't care, I don't like C++.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-why-not-c class=outline-3><h3 id=why-not-c>why not C++?</h3><div id=outline-text-why-not-c class=outline-text-3><p>C++ is an unbelievably convoluted mess of legacy features and tacked on
modern features. unfortunately because they are committed to backwards
compatibility, their new features are added with bizarre syntactic
conventions. also, <code class=verbatim>std::me::donot_care_for_the_naming_convention</code>,
terrible template syntax, and slow compile times. i also hate header
files and redefinition and forward declarations, and much prefer
modules.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-an-assessment-of-the-problem class=outline-3><h3 id=an-assessment-of-the-problem>an assessment of the problem</h3><div id=outline-text-an-assessment-of-the-problem class=outline-text-3><p>so now I had a good reason and a need to port D to GBA. but doing this
blind could prove pretty hard! who knows what needs to be done to get D
to run on GBA? on this front, thankfully there was a
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/3ds-hello-dlang>project that ported d to
3ds with devkitarm</a>. if that worked, it was quite likely I could whip
up something working for the GBA!</p></div></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-the-process class=outline-2><h2 id=the-process>the process</h2><div id=outline-text-the-process class=outline-text-2><div id=outline-container-starting-from-what-works class=outline-3><h3 id=starting-from-what-works>starting from what works</h3><div id=outline-text-starting-from-what-works class=outline-text-3><p>of course, i used the obvious starting point: copy pasting from the D on
3ds project!</p><p>it looks like that project worked by using
<a href=https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc>LDC</a>, the LLVM compiler for D
to generate executable arm7tdmi code. and then using the devkitarm tools
to link and package the rom. as for providing basic minimal runtime D
functionality, it utilized a <em>very</em> minimal replacement runtime library.</p><p>so i took that
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/duster/commit/2d49dd97d5b1c60bfc1c114f55b416b94708ab17>minimal
runtime library</a> and added some code that defined conditional
compilation for the GBA, for the most part just copying what had been
put in for the 3ds.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-forced-to-use-betterc class=outline-3><h3 id=forced-to-use-betterc>forced to use betterc</h3><div id=outline-text-forced-to-use-betterc class=outline-text-3><p>of course, the functionality required for full D support would include
things like garbage collection and threading, which would likely either
be extremely tedious or not feasible to support on these bare metal
devices. all of this is normally provided by the D runtime library,
which we are replacing with a stripped down minimal one. luckily, D
<a href=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/08/23/d-as-a-better-c/>provides</a> a mode
called <a href=https://dlang.org/spec/betterc.html>betterc</a>.</p><p>with betterc mode, we
<a href=https://dlang.org/spec/betterc.html#consequences>lose access</a> to
some language features, most notably: - garbage collection - runtime
reflection and type metadata - classes - threading - dynamic arrays -
static module constructors/destructors</p><p>despite that, we get to keep everything else that's cool about D, which
still makes it a large win over C or C++.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-compiling-d-code class=outline-3><h3 id=compiling-d-code>compiling D code</h3><div id=outline-text-compiling-d-code class=outline-text-3><p>updating the makefile to compile object files from D source was
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/duster/commit/bfb0c1c0ea0157351edf6551729dcfe2c4bfaaf9>surprisingly
simple</a>. i did find a
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/duster/commit/dd463933e78dce0d3b2b90584ee12a4a9aec7fd1>pitfall</a>
where I had to explicitly specify strict memory alignment, because the
GBA force-aligns misaligned memory accesses.</p><p>i also ported all of dusk from C to D manually, and left some parts of
the contrib C files, like gbfs and gbamap as C. D has great support for
linking to C object files, so that doesn't present us any issues as long
as we're specifying <code class=verbatim>extern (C)</code>.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-porting-tonc class=outline-3><h3 id=porting-tonc>porting tonc</h3><div id=outline-text-porting-tonc class=outline-text-3><p>porting tonc headers to D was
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/duster/commits/3f13ad5fe4e0affe06284da7145da99a2dd4b608/src/libd/tonc>fairly
straightforward</a>. nothing out of the ordinary really. i just used
<a href=https://github.com/jacob-carlborg/dstep>dstep</a> to automate 90% of
the conversion, then did a little manual fixing. i also had to add back
in inline functions, as you can't link to tonc functions that are
inline.</p><p>at this point, our <code class=verbatim>libd</code> tonc is pretty much a drop in replacement for
C tonc. note that it's just headers; we still link against the very same
libtonc binary! so there's no need to install anything new, our support
for D compilation is solely within our own source tree!</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-creating-a-minimal-d-library class=outline-3><h3 id=creating-a-minimal-d-library>creating a minimal D library</h3><div id=outline-text-creating-a-minimal-d-library class=outline-text-3><p>at this point, we were ready to separate our D library into its own
thing. i
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/gba_dlang/commit/51b5787f77cbd9843e1dfd60a1af932cdbfc3e83>moved</a>
everything into <a href=https://github.com/redthing1/gba_dlang>gba_dlang</a>.
this way, using my ported D support for the GBA was as simple as adding
a submodule and updating your makefile. also, this new project comes
complete with a
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/gba_dlang/tree/main/demo>working
example</a>. additionally,
<a href=https://github.com/redthing1/gba_dlang/tree/main/libd>libd</a> contains
our D standard library for GBA, known simply as <code class=verbatim>libd</code>!</p></div></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-how-it-all-works class=outline-2><h2 id=how-it-all-works>how it all works</h2><div id=outline-text-how-it-all-works class=outline-text-2><p>i want to quickly give an overview of how the whole thing functions. the
main purpose of this is to serve as a point for future reference.
porting D to any other weird system? this overview might be the
framework to follow.</p><div id=outline-container-distilled-summary class=outline-3><h3 id=distilled-summary>distilled summary</h3><div id=outline-text-distilled-summary class=outline-text-3><ul><li><code class=verbatim>ldc</code> used to compile D sources to <code class=verbatim>.o</code> files.</li><li><code class=verbatim>libd</code> provides a minimal D standard library that is added to default
include path, to provide core functionality and access to the C

gba_dlang to a functioning state was porting the entire duster codebase
from C to D. today, <a href=https://github.com/redthing1/duster>duster</a> is
written entirely in D, save for a couple files.</p><p>with this work, anyone can now program in D for the GBA! need a starting
point? a good way is to just clone duster and strip it down to the bare
minimum, then build your own project using that skeleton. that should
provide a fully functioning project for your own GBA project in dlang.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://beanmachine.alt.icu/post/rtc/><span class=button__text>explaining GBA Real-Time Clock (RTC)</span>
